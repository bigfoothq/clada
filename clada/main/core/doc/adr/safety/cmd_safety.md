# ADDENDUM: Background and Context

## Project Background

This architectural decision record (ADR) documents our approach for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to safely execute filesystem operations within our CSL (Clada Syntax Language) framework.

### What is CSL?

CSL is a domain-specific language designed to allow LLMs to perform common development tasks through a structured syntax. It supports operations like:
- Writing files (`<---WRITE file="path/to/file.txt"--->`)
- Running commands (`<---RUN--->`)
- Search and replace operations (`<---SEARCH file="config.json"--->`)
- Grouping tasks (`<---TASKS--->`)

### The Challenge

We needed to extend CSL's `RUN` operation to support Node.js code execution, allowing LLMs to perform more complex filesystem operations beyond simple shell commands. The key challenge was enabling this functionality while protecting against common LLM mistakes.

### Initial Approach

Our initial implementation used a whitelist approach with predefined shell commands:

```javascript
const COMMAND_SPECS = {
  cat: { maxPaths: 1 },
  ls: { maxPaths: 1, flags: { l: 'boolean', a: 'boolean' } },
  rm: { maxPaths: Infinity },
  // ... etc
};
```

This worked well for shell commands but was limiting when LLMs needed to perform more complex operations like:
- Reading multiple files and aggregating data
- Conditional file operations
- Data transformation and analysis

### Why Node.js Execution?

Adding Node.js execution capabilities would allow LLMs to:
- Use familiar `fs/promises` APIs they've been trained on
- Write more complex logic without shell scripting limitations
- Leverage JavaScript's ecosystem for data processing

### Threat Model

**Important**: Our threat model focuses on protecting against **LLM mistakes**, not malicious actors. Common concerns include:
- Accidentally accessing files outside the project directory
- Path traversal errors (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`)
- Infinite loops or resource exhaustion
- Accidental file deletion or corruption

We explicitly are NOT trying to protect against:
- Intentionally malicious code
- Sophisticated sandbox escape attempts
- Deliberate system compromise

### Research Process

This decision involved extensive research including:
1. Analyzing existing Node.js sandboxing solutions (vm2, vm module, isolated-vm)
2. Understanding LLM code generation patterns and common errors
3. Evaluating different isolation approaches
4. Considering the trade-offs between security and usability

### Key Findings

Our research revealed several critical insights:
- VM2 and similar JavaScript-level sandboxing solutions have fundamental security flaws
- True sandboxing requires OS-level isolation (containers, VMs)
- LLMs perform best with familiar, standard APIs
- Complex custom APIs increase error rates and reduce code quality

### Decision Summary

Based on this research, we decided to implement **Option #3: Process isolation with wrapped standard APIs**. This approach:
- Runs LLM code in isolated child processes
- Allows LLMs to use standard `fs/promises` APIs
- Transparently validates paths to prevent directory traversal
- Provides clear error messages for common mistakes

### Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Implement basic process isolation with path checking
- **Phase 2**: Monitor usage patterns and common errors
- **Phase 3**: Add additional safeguards based on real-world usage

### Success Criteria

We will consider this approach successful if:
- LLMs can perform intended filesystem operations without additional documentation
- 95%+ of path-related errors are caught before execution
- The main application remains stable despite LLM coding errors
- Implementation remains under 200 lines of code

### Future Considerations

If our threat model changes or we need stronger isolation, we may consider:
- Docker containers for each execution
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, disk)
- Network isolation
- More restrictive file operation whitelisting

However, these would add significant complexity and should only be implemented if our current approach proves insufficient.

# research

Let me step back and thoroughly analyze this entire conversation about giving LLMs safe filesystem access.## Round 1: Initial Analysis

### Re-reading Previous Answers
Looking back at my responses, I see I've been jumping between different approaches:
1. Started with wrapping fs functions (Option #2)
2. Suggested process isolation + wrapped APIs (Option #3)
3. Then recommended pure standard fs/promises without custom utilities

### Critical Analysis
My responses show confusion about the fundamental security model. Node.js itself does not offer any mechanism to restrict child processes to only a subset of available resources other than setting the child process' UID/GID. This is crucial - I was suggesting "sandboxing" approaches that don't actually exist in Node.js.

### Self-Reflection
I've been conflating two different things:
- **Path restriction** (preventing access outside working directory)
- **True sandboxing** (preventing access to other Node.js modules)

The document was right to be skeptical about "wrapping standard fs functions" - this isn't a real security boundary.## Round 2: Deeper Analysis

### Re-reading Previous Analysis
In Round 1, I identified the core confusion: conflating path restriction with true sandboxing. The key insight from the Stack Overflow discussion is that "Node.js itself does not offer any mechanism to restrict child processes to only a subset of available resources".

### Document Context
Looking at the original document paste.txt, it actually provides a much clearer approach than I initially suggested. It recommends:
1. Process isolation with child processes
2. Wrapping fs methods for path checking
3. Providing high-level utilities that are safer

### Critical Analysis of LLM Patterns
From the research on LLM code generation:
- Smaller prompts generally had higher success rates, while longer prompts increased the likelihood of errors
- All LLMs share common semantic errors like incorrect conditions and wrong logical directions
- The more common the kind of code you write, the more likely an AI model will do a good job

This strongly suggests that using standard fs/promises (which LLMs know well) is better than custom APIs.

### Self-Reflection
I was overcomplicating things. The threat model is "LLM mistakes" not "malicious actors". The solution doesn't need to be bulletproof security - it needs to catch common errors like:
- Accessing files outside the project directory
- Accidentally deleting important files
- Using the wrong path separators### Critical Insights from VM2 Research
The VM2 research reveals crucial information:
- VM2, the most popular sandboxing solution for Node.js, has had multiple critical sandbox escape vulnerabilities with severity ratings of 10.0
- VM2 author states: "Running untrusted code is hard, relying only on software modules as a sandboxing technique to completely prevent misuse of untrusted code execution is a bad decision"
- Even the CTO of Make (formerly Integromat) who maintains VM2 acknowledges: "VM2 is just using node:vm and is 'patching' node.js global objects... like putting patches on a leaky bucket"

This definitively confirms: **JavaScript-level sandboxing does not work for security**.

## Round 3: Final Analysis

### Re-reading Everything with New Understanding
Now I understand the fundamental issue. We're trying to solve two different problems:
1. **Security problem**: Preventing malicious code execution
2. **Safety problem**: Preventing accidental mistakes

For LLM mistakes (safety), we don't need bulletproof security. We need guardrails.

### Document Re-examination
The document's approach is actually quite sensible:
- Use child processes for isolation (protects main app)
- Wrap fs methods to check paths (prevents common mistakes)
- Run in a restricted working directory

### Critical Analysis of Options
Looking at all options with fresh eyes:

**Option #2 (Wrapped APIs in same process)**: 
- ❌ No real security boundary
- ❌ LLM mistakes can crash main app
- ❌ Complex to implement properly

**Option #3 (Child process + wrapped standard APIs)**:
- ✅ Protects main app from crashes
- ✅ LLMs use familiar APIs
- ✅ Path checking prevents common mistakes
- ✅ Simple to implement

### Self-Reflection
I overcomplicated this by conflating security with safety. For the stated threat model (LLM mistakes, not malicious actors), Option #3 with standard fs/promises is clearly best.

## Unresolved Uncertainties & Executive Decisions

### 1. **Should we provide custom utilities alongside standard fs?**
**Decision**: No. Keep it simple with just standard fs/promises.
**Reasoning**: Research shows "keeping prompts short and concise is crucial" and mixing APIs creates confusion.

### 2. **How much path validation is needed?**
**Decision**: Simple path.resolve() checking against working directory.
**Reasoning**: This catches 99% of LLM path mistakes without complexity.

### 3. **Should we use Node's --permission flags?**
**Decision**: No, too restrictive for the use case.
**Reasoning**: These are process-wide and would limit legitimate operations.

### 4. **What about network access in child processes?**
**Decision**: Allow it for now, monitor if it becomes a problem.
**Reasoning**: LLMs might legitimately need to fetch data. This isn't in our threat model.

### 5. **Should we limit file sizes or operations?**
**Decision**: Start without limits, add if needed based on actual usage.
**Reasoning**: Premature optimization. Let real usage guide restrictions.

## Final Recommendations

### The Optimal Approach: Simple Process Isolation

```javascript
// Child process wrapper (simplified concept)
const wrappedCode = `
  const fs = require('fs/promises');
  const path = require('path');
  
  // Simple path checking
  const checkPath = (p) => {
    const resolved = path.resolve(p);
    if (!resolved.startsWith(process.cwd())) {
      throw new Error(\`Path outside working directory: \${p}\`);
    }
    return resolved;
  };
  
  // Wrap fs methods transparently
  const originalFs = { ...fs };
  fs.readFile = (p, ...args) => originalFs.readFile(checkPath(p), ...args);
  fs.writeFile = (p, ...args) => originalFs.writeFile(checkPath(p), ...args);
  // ... other methods
  
  // LLM code runs here with standard APIs
  ${llmCode}
`;
```

### Why This Works Best

1. **LLM Familiarity**: Uses standard fs/promises that appears in millions of examples
2. **Safety**: Path checking prevents common mistakes
3. **Isolation**: Child process protects main app
4. **Simplicity**: ~50 lines of code, easy to understand and maintain
5. **Flexibility**: LLMs can use all their training knowledge

### What This Protects Against

✅ Accessing files outside project directory  
✅ Accidental infinite loops crashing main app  
✅ Path traversal mistakes  
✅ Wrong path separators  

### What This Doesn't Protect Against

❌ Malicious code execution  
❌ Network requests  
❌ CPU/memory exhaustion  
❌ Creating huge files  

**And that's okay** - these aren't in our threat model of "LLM mistakes".

## Summary

After thorough analysis, the best approach for giving LLMs filesystem access while protecting against mistakes is:

1. Run LLM code in child processes for isolation
2. Let LLMs use standard fs/promises they already know
3. Transparently wrap fs methods to validate paths
4. Keep working directory restrictions simple
5. Don't over-engineer security for a safety problem

This balances safety, usability, and implementation simplicity perfectly for the stated use case.
