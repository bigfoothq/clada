TLDR - give up on OS level security.  cant protect the computer and the user's photo album while using the user's user.  and it has to use the same user to do useful dev stuff.

>ok so it seems like we should abandon the idea of OS level protections all togheter... right?  and just focus on node level protectiosn... we can have a restricted dev environment with whitelisted modules and a wrapped 'fs' that blocks illiegal fs activities ... .but still allows stuff like 'npm install' etc, if whitelisted by the human....

Yes, abandon OS-level protections. They're the wrong tool for this problem.

Node-level approach is more viable:

**Advantages:**
- Fine-grained control over fs operations
- Can intercept before execution
- Whitelist/blacklist paths programmatically  
- Works consistently across platforms

**Key challenges:**

1. **npm/tooling bypass** - npm directly calls OS functions, not Node's fs
   - Solution: Spawn npm in restricted subprocess with explicit env vars
   - Or: Pre-approve package.json changes, run npm outside sandbox

2. **Module ecosystem** - Many packages use native bindings that bypass Node's fs
   - child_process.exec('rm -rf') still unrestricted
   - Native modules can syscall directly

3. **Whitelist maintenance** - Dev tools touch many paths:
   - ~/.npm, ~/.cache, node_modules, .git
   - Build outputs, temp files, logs
   - Config files across home directory

**Realistic implementation:**
- Wrap fs module for path validation
- Intercept child_process to filter dangerous commands
- Run in dedicated workspace directory
- Require human approval for operations outside workspace
- Accept that determined/clever code can bypass

This gives reasonable protection against accidental damage while maintaining dev workflow. Not bulletproof, but matches the "well-intentioned but error-prone" threat model better than OS-level attempts.

#@&^$&#^%$@&#^%$@&#^%$

so this is waht we need to do:

- wrap fs, path, and glob
- whitelist npm modules.  start with only those 3 wrapped ones.  and maybe start with whitelist for readonly stuff
- allow multi-line node code 
- allow single-line shell commands only.  no piping or combo commands or funny stuff.  no string concat.  this way we can manually validate every file path. 
- allow whitelist for any other shell commands including combos or piping or concat etc.  literal command matches only. main use case here is running tests and doing basic build install commands

BUT WAIT -- what about node permission model?? focus on that now.
