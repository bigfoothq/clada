TODO!! NOTE !! this might all be total trash! check ou these commenets:

Looking at these covs and tests more critically:

**adapter.cov.md** - This looks solid. It covers:
- All operation types (WRITE, SEARCH exact/range, RUN, TASKS)
- Edge cases (invalid count, missing append)
- The transformation rules are clear and testable

**adapter.test.ts** - Good implementation, matches the covenant precisely.

**orchestrate.cov.md** - I have some concerns:
1. The covenant descriptions are too implementation-focused (mentioning mocks, console logs)
2. It's mixing behavioral specification with test implementation details
3. The format doesn't follow the clean inputâ†’output pattern of the adapter covenant

**orchestrate.test.ts** - The mocking approach might be overly complex. Also, I'm not sure the mock.module() API works the way I've written it.

Let me revise the orchestrate covenant to be cleaner:

Rewriting orchestrate.cov.md to focus on behavioral contracts rather than implementation details

# Orchestrate Covenant

## orchestrate

Orchestrates CSL parsing and execution, coordinating between

@#(*$@(#*$&@#(*$&)))

so we might need to probably yes totally rewrite this.  just the cov!! dont do test simultanesouts!


# Orchestrate Covenant

## orchestrate

Orchestrates CSL parsing and execution.

### Basic execution
- Given CSL with single WRITE operation and mocked executeWrite that returns {ok: true}
- When `orchestrate('<---WRITE FILE="test.txt"--->\nHello\n<---/WRITE--->', {workingDir: '/tmp'})`
- Then executeWrite is called with `{path: 'test.txt', content: 'Hello', append: false}` and console logs success

### Multiple operations
- Given CSL with WRITE and EDIT operations and mocked components that return {ok: true}
- When `orchestrate('<---WRITE FILE="test.txt"--->\nHello\n<---/WRITE--->\n<---SEARCH FILE="test.txt"--->\nHello\n<---REPLACE--->\nGoodbye\n<---/SEARCH--->', {workingDir: '/tmp'})`
- Then executeWrite is called once, executeEdit is called once, and console logs two successes

### TASKS block execution
- Given CSL with TASKS containing two operations and mocked components that return {ok: true}
- When `orchestrate('<---TASKS VERSION="1.0"--->\n<---WRITE FILE="a.txt"--->\nA\n<---/WRITE--->\n<---WRITE FILE="b.txt"--->\nB\n<---/WRITE--->\n<---/TASKS--->', {workingDir: '/tmp'})`
- Then executeWrite is called twice and console logs two successes

### Skip invalid operation
- Given CSL with invalid WRITE (missing FILE) and valid WRITE, and mocked executeWrite
- When `orchestrate('<---WRITE--->\nInvalid\n<---/WRITE--->\n<---WRITE FILE="valid.txt"--->\nValid\n<---/WRITE--->', {workingDir: '/tmp'})`
- Then executeWrite is called only once with valid operation, console warns about skipped operation

### Skip entire TASKS block with error
- Given CSL with TASKS containing one invalid operation and mocked components
- When `orchestrate('<---TASKS VERSION="1.0"--->\n<---WRITE--->\nNo file\n<---/WRITE--->\n<---WRITE FILE="good.txt"--->\nGood\n<---/WRITE--->\n<---/TASKS--->', {workingDir: '/tmp'})`
- Then executeWrite is never called, console warns about skipped TASKS block

### Handle execution failure
- Given CSL with WRITE operation and mocked executeWrite that returns {ok: false, error: 'Permission denied'}
- When `orchestrate('<---WRITE FILE="test.txt"--->\nHello\n<---/WRITE--->', {workingDir: '/tmp'})`
- Then console logs error with failure details

### Fatal syntax error
- Given CSL with syntax error
- When `orchestrate('<---INVALID SYNTAX', {workingDir: '/tmp'})`
- Then console logs fatal error and process exits with code 1
