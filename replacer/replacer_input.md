Looking at the test failure and the debug output, I can see the issue. The test is failing because the listener isn't detecting the SHAM blocks in the updated file content. Let me trace through what's happening:

1. The initial file has no SHAM blocks, which is processed correctly
2. When the test adds SHAM blocks to the file, the listener detects the file change
3. However, the orchestrator still reports 0 blocks found

The debug output shows that when the file is read after the SHAM block is added, it's not being processed. Looking at the listener code, I notice that the diagnostic logs show the file read happening, but then the test times out waiting for the SHAM execution results.

Let me check the timing and the actual processing flow:The issue appears to be that the second file read (after the SHAM block is added) isn't happening or isn't being processed correctly. Looking at the debug output more carefully:

1. First read shows file with 34 chars (just the header)
2. File change is detected
3. But we don't see a second "FILE READ" debug output

This suggests the debounced process might not be executing after the file change. Let me look at the listener code more carefully:Looking more closely at the test output, I see that "Debounced process executing" appears twice:
1. Once at the beginning (for the initial file)
2. Once after "File change detected"

But the second execution doesn't show any file read debug output. This suggests the `processFileChange` function might be returning early. Let me check the cooldown logic:Found it! The issue is the 2-second cooldown in the `processFileChange` function. When the test:

1. Starts the listener (processes initial file)
2. Waits for initial processing 
3. Immediately writes new content with SHAM blocks

The second processing is blocked by the cooldown because less than 2 seconds have passed since the initial execution.

Here's the fix:

<<<EXPLANATION>>>
The test is failing because the listener has a 2-second cooldown between executions, but the test writes the new file content immediately after the initial processing. This causes the second file change to be ignored due to the cooldown. We need to add a delay in the test to ensure the cooldown period has passed.

The issue is that the listener component has a 2-second cooldown between processing cycles to prevent rapid re-execution. The tests were trying to update files immediately after the initial processing, which was within the cooldown window, causing the updates to be ignored.

By adding a 2.1 second delay after initial processing, we ensure the cooldown period has passed and the listener will process the file changes containing the SHAM blocks.
