Perfect! This confirms that `marked.Tokens` doesn't exist as an export. The tokens are just plain objects with a `type` property.

Since:
1. `npm run build` passes (no actual TypeScript errors)
2. The tests pass
3. It's just an IDE issue

Let's check if the issue persists with my last fix applied. If the IDE is still complaining after the type assertion approach, we have a few options:

1. **Ignore the IDE** - if `npm run build` passes, the code is fine
2. **Add explicit type annotations** to help the IDE:

<<<EXPLANATION>>>
Add explicit type imports to help the IDE understand marked better

<<<FILE>>>
./proj/comp/sham-action-parser/test/parseShamResponse.test.ts
<<<SEARCH>>>
import { marked } from 'marked';
<<<REPLACE>>>
import { marked, Token } from 'marked';
<<<END>>>

<<<EXPLANATION>>>
Use the Token type explicitly

<<<FILE>>>
./proj/comp/sham-action-parser/test/parseShamResponse.test.ts
<<<SEARCH>>>
const tokens = marked.lexer(mdContent);
const codeBlocks = tokens.filter(t => t.type === 'code') as Array<{type: 'code', text: string}>;
<<<REPLACE>>>
const tokens: Token[] = marked.lexer(mdContent);
const codeBlocks = tokens.filter(t => t.type === 'code') as Array<Token & {type: 'code', text: string}>;
<<<END>>>

But honestly, if `npm run build` works and tests pass, this is just IDE noise. The TypeScript compiler (which is what matters for the build) is happy with the code.

What's your preference:
1. Leave it as is since the build works
2. Add `// @ts-ignore` comments for the IDE
3. Try more type gymnastics

I'd vote for #1 - if the official TypeScript compiler is happy, we should trust it over the IDE.
