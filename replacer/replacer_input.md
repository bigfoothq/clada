ERROR Block 1: No match found in /Users/stuart/repos/clada/proj/comp/sham-action-parser/src/index.ts
===

The error shows "Unknown action: files_read" which means the SHAM parser isn't recognizing this action. Looking at the error pattern, this is happening during the parsing/validation phase, not the execution phase.

The issue is that the action schema is loaded from `unified-design.yaml`, but the parser is caching this schema. Even though you tried clearing the cache, the problem persists.

Let me check the action schema loading in the parser:

Looking at the error, I see the real issue. The error "Unknown action: files_read" is coming from the SHAM parser validation phase. This means the parser isn't finding `files_read` in the `unified-design.yaml` schema.

The problem is likely that the `actionSchemaCache` in the SHAM parser is being populated once and never refreshed. ES modules have a separate cache from CommonJS `require.cache`, and there's no standard way to invalidate the ES module cache.

Let me trace through the issue:

1. The test runs and loads the schema from `unified-design.yaml`
2. The schema is cached in `actionSchemaCache`
3. When we added `files_read` to the yaml file, the cache wasn't invalidated
4. The parser still sees the old cached schema without `files_read`

Let's force the schema to reload by clearing the cache:

<<<EXPLANATION>>>
The actionSchemaCache is preventing the parser from seeing the new files_read action. We need to clear this cache before each test or make it reload the schema. The simplest fix is to set the cache to null at the start of parseShamResponse to force a reload.

<<<FILE>>>
/Users/stuart/repos/clada/proj/comp/sham-action-parser/src/index.ts

<<<SEARCH>>>
// Cache for action schema
let actionSchemaCache: Map<string, ActionDefinition> | null = null;

/**
 * Parse SHAM blocks from text into validated clada actions
 * Processes all blocks, collecting successes and errors
 */
export async function parseShamResponse(shamText: string): Promise<ParseResult> {
<<<REPLACE>>>
// Cache for action schema
let actionSchemaCache: Map<string, ActionDefinition> | null = null;

/**
 * Parse SHAM blocks from text into validated clada actions
 * Processes all blocks, collecting successes and errors
 */
export async function parseShamResponse(shamText: string): Promise<ParseResult> {
  // Force reload of schema to pick up changes during development
  actionSchemaCache = null;
<<<END>>>

This is a temporary fix. A better solution would be to either:
1. Load the schema once at startup and pass it as a parameter
2. Use a file watcher to invalidate the cache when `unified-design.yaml` changes
3. Have a development mode flag that disables caching

But for now, this will ensure the tests pick up the new `files_read` action.
