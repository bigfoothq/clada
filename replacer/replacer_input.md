Good - the `.only` isolation worked. The test completes successfully when run alone, confirming the issue isn't with the test itself but with running multiple tests in sequence.

The hanging was likely due to:
1. **Resource contention** - Multiple tests trying to access the same files
2. **Async timing issues** - Tests starting before previous cleanup completes
3. **parseShamResponse caching** - The `actionSchemaCache` is shared across tests

Let's remove the `.only` and fix the real issue:

<<<EXPLANATION>>>
Remove the .only isolation since we've confirmed the individual test works
<<<FILE>>>
/Users/stuart/repos/clada/proj/comp/fs-ops/test/integration/integration.test.ts
<<<SEARCH>>>
      group.tests.forEach(test => {
        // Temporarily isolate first test
        const itFn = test.name === '001-simple-file-create' ? it.only : it;
        itFn(test.name, async () => {
<<<REPLACE>>>
      group.tests.forEach(test => {
        it(test.name, async () => {
<<<END>>>

<<<EXPLANATION>>>
Make beforeEach async to ensure cleanup completes before test starts
<<<FILE>>>
/Users/stuart/repos/clada/proj/comp/fs-ops/test/integration/integration.test.ts
<<<SEARCH>>>
  beforeEach(() => {
    console.log('[beforeEach] Starting cleanup');
    // Clean up any existing test files
    testPaths.forEach(path => {
      if (existsSync(path)) {
        console.log('[beforeEach] Removing:', path);
        rmSync(path, { recursive: true, force: true });
      }
    });
    console.log('[beforeEach] Cleanup complete');
  });
<<<REPLACE>>>
  beforeEach(async () => {
    console.log('[beforeEach] Starting cleanup');
    // Clean up any existing test files
    testPaths.forEach(path => {
      if (existsSync(path)) {
        console.log('[beforeEach] Removing:', path);
        rmSync(path, { recursive: true, force: true });
      }
    });
    console.log('[beforeEach] Cleanup complete');
    // Small delay to ensure filesystem operations complete
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));
  });
<<<END>>>

The key insight: The `actionSchemaCache` in `parseShamResponse` is loaded once and shared. This shouldn't cause hanging, but the file system operations might be overlapping if cleanup isn't fully synchronous.
