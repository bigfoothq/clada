SUCCESS Block 1: Updated /Users/stuart/repos/clada/proj/test/execute.test.ts

Good implementation. Clean separation of files/directories.

**Remaining issue**: `/tmp/deeply` is orphaned - nothing creates it. The test creates `/tmp/new/deeply/nested/` so only `/tmp/new` needs cleanup.

<<<EXPLANATION>>>
Remove orphaned test directory that's never created
<<<FILE>>>
/Users/stuart/repos/clada/proj/test/execute.test.ts
<<<SEARCH>>>
const testDirs = [
  '/tmp/new',
  '/tmp/deeply'
];
<<<REPLACE>>>
const testDirs = [
  '/tmp/new'
];
<<<END>>>

Otherwise solid. The error isolation prevents cascade failures, and the separate handling is more efficient than `recursive: true` on everything.
