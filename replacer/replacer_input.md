Looking at the test failures, I can see three issues:

1. **file_move test 004**: The test expects the move operation to succeed with `overwrote: true`, but it's failing because the source file doesn't exist. This suggests the test setup is creating files but they're being lost between SHAM blocks.

2. **file_replace_lines test 002**: Expected 3 lines replaced but got 4. Looking at the test, it's replacing lines 2-5, which is actually 4 lines (2, 3, 4, 5), not 3.

3. **file_replace_lines test 012**: Expected failure when replacing in empty file, but it succeeded. The current implementation doesn't properly handle empty files.

Let me fix these issues:

<<<EXPLANATION>>>
Fix the file_replace_lines calculation bug - when replacing lines 2-5, that's 4 lines not 3. The calculation should be endLine - startLine + 1.

<<<SEARCH>>>
    const linesReplaced = endLine - startLine + 1;
<<<REPLACE>>>
    const linesReplaced = endLine - startLine + 1;
<<<END>>>

Wait, that's already correct. Let me check the test expectation:

The test expectation is wrong. When replacing lines 2-5, that's 4 lines (2, 3, 4, 5), not 3. Fix the test expectation.

<<<EXPLANATION>>>
Fix the file_replace_lines implementation to properly handle empty files. When a file has 0 lines, we should check this before trying to replace any lines.

    const fileLines = content.split(/\r?\n|\r/);
    // Handle edge case: empty file returns [''] which is 1 line, but should be 0
    const totalLines = content === '' ? 0 : fileLines.length;
<<<END>>>

<<<EXPLANATION>>>
For the file_move test, the issue appears to be that the test is trying to move a file that was created in a previous SHAM block. Looking at the test runner, it seems to handle multiple SHAM blocks sequentially. The test itself looks correct - it creates both source and destination files, then tries to move. This might be a race condition or file system issue. Let's check if the file exists before the pre-flight check.
<<<FILE>>>
/Users/stuart/repos/clada/proj/comp/fs-ops/src/index.ts
<<<SEARCH>>>
async function handleFileMove(action: CladaAction): Promise<FileOpResult> {
  const { old_path, new_path } = action.parameters;
  
  try {
    // Pre-flight check for better error messages
    const sourceExists = await fileExists(old_path);
    if (!sourceExists) {
      return {
        success: false,
        error: `file_move: Source file not found '${old_path}' (ENOENT)`
      };
    }
<<<REPLACE>>>
async function handleFileMove(action: CladaAction): Promise<FileOpResult> {
  const { old_path, new_path } = action.parameters;
  
  try {
    // Pre-flight check for better error messages
    const sourceExists = await fileExists(old_path);
    if (!sourceExists) {
      return {
        success: false,
        error: `file_move: Source file not found '${old_path}' (ENOENT)`
      };
    }
<<<END>>>

Actually, the file_move code looks correct. The test is expecting success but getting a "source file not found" error. This suggests the file created in the first SHAM block isn't persisting to the move operation. Let me check the test more carefully...

Looking at the test runner, I see it's tracking created paths and executing actions sequentially. The issue might be in how the test processes multiple SHAM blocks. Each SHAM block creates a new set of actions, and the test correctly executes them all in sequence. However, test 004 creates two files separately before moving, and it's the first file that's missing.

Wait, I see the issue! In the test runner, it's not tracking the file path correctly:

<<<EXPLANATION>>>
The test runner needs to track all file paths created, not just the last one. When processing multiple actions, it's overwriting targetFilePath instead of collecting all paths.
<<<FILE>>>
/Users/stuart/repos/clada/proj/comp/fs-ops/test/integration/integration.test.ts
<<<SEARCH>>>
              // Track the file path for content verification
              if (action.path) {
                targetFilePath = action.path;
                
                // Track created paths for cleanup
                const testDirMatch = action.path.match(/\/tmp\/t_[^\/]+/);
                if (testDirMatch) {
                  createdPaths.add(testDirMatch[0]);
                }
              }
<<<REPLACE>>>
              // Track the file path for content verification
              if (action.parameters?.path) {
                targetFilePath = action.parameters.path;
                
                // Track created paths for cleanup
                const testDirMatch = action.parameters.path.match(/\/tmp\/t_[^\/]+/);
                if (testDirMatch) {
                  createdPaths.add(testDirMatch[0]);
                }
              }
              // Also track old_path for file_move operations
              if (action.parameters?.old_path) {
                const testDirMatch = action.parameters.old_path.match(/\/tmp\/t_[^\/]+/);
                if (testDirMatch) {
                  createdPaths.add(testDirMatch[0]);
                }
              }
<<<END>>>

Actually, that's for cleanup tracking. The real issue is that the test is failing because the source file truly doesn't exist. Let me run through what test 004 is doing:

1. Creates `/tmp/t_move-to-existing-file/source-exists.txt`
2. Creates `/tmp/t_move-to-existing-file/dest-exists.txt` 
3. Tries to move source to dest

But the move operation says source doesn't exist. This suggests either:
- The file writes aren't completing before the move
- There's something wrong with the test setup

Since other tests pass, including simpler move tests, this might be specific to test 004. Let me check if there's something unique about it...

Actually, I think the issue might be async timing. All the operations are awaited properly though. Let me check if the paths in the test match exactly:

The test looks correct. All paths match. This might be a timing issue where the file system hasn't flushed the writes before the move operation. Since this is the only test failing in this way, and it's specifically the one that creates two files before moving, it might be worth adding a small delay or ensuring the writes are flushed.

However, the better approach is to make sure our file operations are truly complete. The Node.js `writeFile` with await should be synchronous from our perspective. 

Let me check one more thing - the test might have a typo or formatting issue in the SHAM blocks...

No, the test looks correct. Given that this is the only file_move test failing, and it's the one that creates multiple files, I suspect there might be an issue with how the test runner is handling multiple file creations. But without being able to debug it directly, the code itself looks correct.

For now, let's focus on the fixes we can make - the file_replace_lines issues are clear and we can fix those.
