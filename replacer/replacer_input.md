The tests are failing because we deleted the functions but didn't delete their test files. Either:

1. Delete the test files (they're testing trivial wrappers)
2. Keep the functions

Since you already have tests written and they're passing, keeping the functions has merit. They do provide value:
- `getParentDirectory` handles Windows paths specially (though `dirname` might already do this correctly)
- `getByteLength` is more readable than `Buffer.byteLength(content, 'utf8')`

**Recommendation**: Keep the pure functions, they're harmless and tested. Just fix `ensureDirectoryExists` to use `mkdir` with recursive:

This keeps your existing abstractions but fixes the bug and simplifies the implementation.
