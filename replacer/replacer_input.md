SUCCESS Block 1: Updated /Users/stuart/repos/clada/proj/comp/fs-ops/test/integration/integration.test.ts
===

The test failure shows that the `files_read` action expects files to exist, but the test setup isn't executing the prerequisite `file_write` actions. The parser correctly identifies 4 actions (3 file writes + 1 files_read), but the test only executes the last action.

The issue is here:

```typescript
// Execute the last action (main action, after any setup actions)
const result = await executeFileOperation(parseResult.actions[parseResult.actions.length - 1]);
```

This assumes setup actions are handled elsewhere, but they're not. For multi-file read tests, you need to execute all actions in sequence.

<<<EXPLANATION>>>

Execute all actions in sequence for tests that require setup actions before the main action

<<<SEARCH>>>
          // Execute the last action (main action, after any setup actions)
          const result = await executeFileOperation(parseResult.actions[parseResult.actions.length - 1]);
<<<REPLACE>>>
          // Execute all actions in sequence, capturing the last result
          let result;
          for (const action of parseResult.actions) {
            result = await executeFileOperation(action);
          }
<<<END>>>

This change ensures setup actions (file writes) execute before the main action (files_read), matching the test's intended behavior.
