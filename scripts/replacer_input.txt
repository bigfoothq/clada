SUCCESS Block 1: Updated /Users/stuart/repos/clada/clada/main/components/write/main/core/src/execute.ts
===

An analysis of the test failure shows that the `handles execution failure` test in `orchestrate.test.ts` is failing. This test is designed to verify that the system correctly handles errors when a `WRITE` operation fails. It attempts to write a file to a non-existent directory, expecting this to cause an error.

However, the current implementation of `executeWrite` in `clada/main/components/write/main/core/src/execute.ts` includes logic to automatically create parent directories (`mkdirSync({ recursive: true })`). This "helpful" feature prevents the expected failure from occurring, causing the test's assertion (`assert(!existsSync(...))`) to fail because the file is successfully created.

To fix this, I will modify `executeWrite` to remove the automatic directory creation. This change will make the `WRITE` command fail if the target directory does not exist, aligning the implementation with the test's intent and allowing the error-handling logic to be properly verified.

<<<EXPLANATION>>>
The `handles execution failure` test in `orchestrate.test.ts` is failing because the `executeWrite` function automatically creates parent directories, preventing the intended write failure. To fix this, I am removing the `mkdirSync` logic. This will cause `writeFileSync` to throw an `ENOENT` error when the directory does not exist, which the existing error handling will catch, allowing the test to pass as expected.
